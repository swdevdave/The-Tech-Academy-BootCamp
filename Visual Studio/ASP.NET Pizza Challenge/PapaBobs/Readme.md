Dave King ASP.NET Pizza project Final.
07/23/17 - Visual Studio 2017

This file is a pizza project using C# with ASP.NET.

In this project Bootstrap, Jquery and Entity Framework NuGets are used. For the Database SQL server is used. 

In order to use and test the project you need to rewire the Db to your local folders. You will need to open persistnace and Web and change
the values for the db location. The DB is located in .WEB/App_Data folder. Go into App.Config & Web.Config and rename the paths.

Default is the main page. And in order to see the values use /ordermanagement.aspx 

The key things I learned with this project were using a Db with C#, connecting up an ADO.NET entity model, and setting up a
solid file structure  while passing the values throughout the project.
