FINAL EXERCISE: 
          
As mentioned throughout our program, one of the skills required of a developer is problem solving and learning new technologies. This final exercise exists to have you learn something new without us providing you with the resources. Meaning, you will now be required to do something that you haven't been taught. This challenge is meant to better prepare you for future job and life situations wherein you will need to learn new technologies on your own.

There are four challenges to choose from. Pick one that interests you and that you are not already familiar with. After you have chosen which challenge you would like to do, train yourself up in that area. Research the area online, read articles, watch tutorials, etc. After you have an understanding of the technology involved, tackle the challenge.

NOTE: One could easily spend days or even weeks on these challenges but this Final Exercise is only meant to take hours. Keep your project very simple and basic for time's sake.

Here are the four challenges to choose from:

1. Make a C# application using Entity Framework Code First.


This is a Registration Page. There is so much more I can add, but this more than meets the requirements for the final Excercise.

I added in Password hash, Admin Login, Success Landing page and much more! Download and give it a try!
